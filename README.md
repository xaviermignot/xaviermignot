### Hi there 👋

I'm an Azure technical guy who has recently moved from France to Québec. My professional work is done in private Azure DevOps organizations, so only my personal stuff is featured here.

- 🏢 I work for Edgenda, a Québec-based training and technology company, and have started a new gig in the public sector, where I'm helping to move various workloads to Azure using IaC.
- ⏲️ I was working previously as a freelancer in the Bordeaux area in France, I had spent a few months writing Terraform code for a banking company (and learning good stuff about K8S, containers and ELK in an awesome team). Before that I was the lead dev of an IoT projet on energy management, using Azure IoT and mostly coding in C#. Before that I did a lot of .NET in my professional life.
- ✍️ You can read my personal tech blog [here](https://blog/xmi.fr)
- My recent side projects were focused on IaC (Terraform and Bicep) and CI/CD stuff, I would like to get back to the IoT and _real_ coding business 🤓
- 🌱 I also would like to spend more time learing K8S, and give a shot to gRPC APIs.
- 💬 Ask me about anything regarding Azure IoT, IaC or Azure PaaS services
