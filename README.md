### Hi there 👋

I'm an Azure technical guy located in the Bordeaux area in France. My professional work is done in private Azure DevOps organizations, so only my personal stuff is featured here.

- 🏢 I have just relocated back home and have restarted to work as a freelancer. Whatever the stage of your cloud journey, don't hesitate to reach out if you need help 🤗
- ⏲️ I was working previously for Edgenda, a Québec-based training and technology company, helping several customers of the public sector to more their workloads in Azure using IaC.
- ⏲️ Before that I was already working as a freelancer, had spent a few months writing Terraform code for a banking company (and learning good stuff about K8S, containers and ELK in an awesome team), was the lead dev of an IoT projet on energy management using Azure IoT and mostly coding in C#. And even before that I did a lot of .NET in my professional life.
- ✍️ You can read my personal tech blog [here](https://blog.xmi.fr)
- My recent side projects were focused on IaC (Terraform and Bicep) and CI/CD stuff, I would like to get back to the IoT and _real_ coding business 🤓
- 🌱 I also would like to spend more time learing K8S, and give a shot to gRPC APIs.
- 💬 Ask me about anything regarding Azure IoT, IaC or Azure PaaS services
