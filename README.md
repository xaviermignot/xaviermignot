### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an Azure architect in the Bordeaux area in France. My professional work is done in private Azure DevOps organizations, so only my personal stuff is featured here.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an IoT projet on energy management in my professional life. Personally I try to set-up a website using Jekyll, and I have various IoT boards to play with
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Power Platform, Terraform, and Jekyll. Next I'll dive into Azure Digital Twins and gRPC APIs in .NET Core
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything regarding Azure IoT or Azure PaaS services
