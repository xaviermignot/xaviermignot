### Hi there 👋

I'm an Azure architect in the Bordeaux area in France. My professional work is done in private Azure DevOps or GitLab organizations, so only my personal stuff is featured here.

- 🏢 I'm currently working in an awesome team building Azure infrastructure for a banking company, doing lots of Terraform code and having a ton to learn on Kubernetes and containers
- ⏲️ My previous job was a lead dev role on an IoT projet on energy management, using Azure IoT and mostly coding in C#. Before that I did a lot of .NET in my professional life.
- Personally I try to set-up a website using Jekyll, and I have various IoT boards to play with
- 🌱 I'm currently doing a lot of experimentations with Terraform, and would like to spend more time learning AKS. I'm still doing some C# with .NET 6 in my free time, and should give a shot to gRPC APIs
- 💬 Ask me about anything regarding Azure IoT or Azure PaaS services
